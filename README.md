# Attack-Chain-Generator
This project implements a rule-based attack chain generator that models adversary behaviour using MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics. By focusing on explainable logic and prioritization rather than attack execution, the tool helps reason about likely next steps in an attack and supports both red team planning and incident response prioritization.
